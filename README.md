# 🧠 Python OOP Assignment – Classes, Inheritance & Polymorphism

This project contains two main parts showcasing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python: **Class Design with Inheritance and Encapsulation**, and a **Polymorphism Challenge** using animals or vehicles.

---

## 📘 Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! 🏗️

### 💡 Objective:
Create a Python class to represent a real-world object. Add attributes and methods, use constructors for initialization, and apply **inheritance** and **encapsulation** where applicable.

### ✅ Features:
- A custom class with unique attributes and methods.
- Constructor method `__init__()` to initialize each object.
- Inherited class to add extra behavior and demonstrate code reuse.
- Encapsulation through controlled access to class data.

### 🦸 Example:
**Superhero class** with powers, strength, and flying speed (using inheritance).

## 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge!

### 💡 Objective:
Demonstrate **polymorphism** by creating different classes (like `Car` and `Plane`) that share the same method name but have different behaviors.

### ✅ Features:
- Parent class (`Vehicle` or `Animal`) with a method (e.g., `move()`).
- Child classes override the `move()` method to perform specific actions.
- Shows how one interface (`move()`) can have many implementations.

### 🚀 Example Output:
```python
car.move()   # Output: Driving 🚗
plane.move() # Output: Flying ✈️
